## FORMATION AND STRUCTURE OF DNA

A DNA molecule consists of two long polynucleotide chains composed of four types of nucleotide subunits. 
Each of these chains is known as a DNA chain, or a DNA strand. Hydrogen bonds between the base portions of the 
nucleotides hold the two chains together.
Nucleotides are composed of a five-carbon sugar to which are attached one or more phosphate groups and a nitrogen-containing base.
The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose and is attached to a single phosphate group. The base may be either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), 
or thymine (T), with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine with cytosine(a bulkier two-ring base, a purine, is always paired with a single-ring base,
a pyrimidine. The nucleotides are covalently linked together in a chain through the sugars and phosphates, forming a "backbone" of alternating 
sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate.

The nucleotide subunits are lined together to give a DNA strand a chemical polarity; the 5'-end having a phosphate and the 3'-end having a hydroxyl.
DNA exists in a three dimensional structure, the double helix. The bases, which are found on the inside of the double helix, are held together
by hydrogen bonding. The sugar-phosphate backbones are found on the outside of the double helix.

DNA must be tightly packed to fit in the nucleus of a cell and this is made possible by wrapping the DNA around structural histone proteins,
which act as scaffolding for DNA to be coiled around. For a nucleosome to be formed, an octamer of histone proteins and 146 to 147 base pairs of DNA
should be there. The millions of nucleosomes tightly coil the continuous DNA strand into chromatin which is further condensed into the chromosome.

## OPEN READING FRAME

This is the region of the nucleotide sequences from the start codon to the stop codon. A codon is a trinucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA 
that corresponds to a specific amino acid.  An open reading frame starts with an atg (Met) in most species and ends with a stop codon (taa, tag or tga). 

## MUTATIONS

Mutations are alterations in the DNA sequence. Germ line mutations are mutations that happen in the germ line (in reproductive cells, sperms or eggs)
and can hence be passed to offsprings during sexual reproduction.
Somatic mutations are mutations that occur in cells found elsewhere in the body (in non-reproductive cells). Somatic mutations are passed to daughter cells during the process of mitosis, 
but they are not passed to offspring conceived via sexual reproduction.
